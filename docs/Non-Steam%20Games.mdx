# Non Steam Games

MicroSDeck supports adding Non-Steam games to MicroSD Cardds. This is to support emulation by since it is possible to install ROM's onto the MicroSD card. Although the functionality of adding Non-Steam games is not limited to just emulation. Any "game" that steam lists can be added to the MicroSD card.

Adding a Non-Steam "game" to the MicroSD card is as easy as opening the MicroSDeck plugin and clicking on the "..." button for the MicroSD card you want to add the game to.
